## Journaling games live in hushed places.

The first journaling game I ever played was the devastating (and now very accessible!) Long Haul 1983 by Sean Patrick Cain. I think about it quite often. If you haven’t played it, you should.

My time with it took me a few hours, huddled over my messy desk, and I cried as I made up a story about someone who didn’t exist trying to outrun an unknowable apocalypse, a trucker and single mom who kept calling her son who was too young to remember her. She died out there, two or three biomes away from making it home.
My first hour or two was nothing but success. I might really make it, I thought, and then I drew several Kings in a row. Disaster set in. The tables turned on me. It was astonishing how fast things could come tumbling down.

In a group, I realized, this would come off as obnoxiously bad luck. Alone, I was not annoyed. I was desperate as I threw the few Aces I had collected at mounting problems to try to make them go away. Eventually I couldn’t outrun the deck. If I had gone on longer, I wouldn’t have been able to outrun the loss of my dice pool.
This wouldn’t have been half as effective without the quiet.

A lot of people who are new to roleplaying games are afraid of Getting Into Character in front of their friends. If you didn’t grow up as a theater kid the idea of putting on a silly different voice or even just a weird little character can be seen as deeply embarrassing. I myself have been playing these games for years, and I refuse to do voices. I am not good at them! I will not subject the people I care about to them.

But there’s a different kind of vulnerability in engaging with a text alone. Long Haul 1983 suggests that you use a microphone to record messages left to your character’s loved one. You can listen back at the end, of course, to see what you wove together, but in the moment it’s just the inherent clumsiness of saying things aloud, alone, with a deck of cards and some dice.

No one is there to hypothetically judge your voice or your character. This can be liberating or frightening.

I’m sure someone has put out some highly edited and produced Long Haul 1983 playthrough. I respect them, but that’s not what interests me. I think about the Long Haul 1983 playthroughs that exist in private, like the one that still sits in my phone’s voice memos. I don’t remember exactly what I said, or the exact order of events, but I remember how I fumbled and went quiet sometimes. As things got worse, I would just sit there, breathing slowly, trying to extend the moment of this voicemail a little longer because it meant I didn’t have to pull cards and roll dice again.

I learned from that experience that one of the best tools you can use in any roleplaying experience — solo or group — was silence, or if not silence itself, then at least a lack of narrative. Journaling games offer this in spades.

I ran into the importance of silence again while working with Mousehole Press’s Lost and Found SRD to make Mythmaker. The SRD offers, to mark the passage of various time, the ability to rest in silence. This is a core part of the game loop. Without it, I doubt any Lost and Found game would be as interesting.
[Rest] also gives the idle minds of the players some space to look backwards & forwards to contemplate the shape of their story, which can be hard to make time for when writing continuously.

The Object you play as in Lost and Found games begins young and becomes ancient. It will outlive people. It may sit for years, or decades, or centuries untouched by another living thing. If your mind wanders over a minute or two of quiet, imagine the places that the Object’s must wander across a hundred years or more.
When something sits alone, it changes, whether for good or bad.

Most roleplaying games exist in a state of constant motion. You are always writing, always rolling, always reading, always talking, always playing. Quiet usually involves doing something else, like marking something down, listening to someone else talk, or contemplating your next move.

Journaling games have a unique ability to demand the player stop and sit.

So what do we make out of that space and air? What do we ask players to do with it? I think these two games exemplify different attitudes: silence as a temporary relief from growing tension or silence as a crushing weight that only grows heavier.

Both of these, I have noticed, are about time. You either take time when you feel as though you shouldn’t, or you are shouldered with time and must carry it unwillingly.

Silence is a mechanic, and I plan to use it.

In The Untitled Big Game, the solo journaling haunted house mecha grief trauma thing that rattles inside my brain like a fucked up demon, I think silence matters. Maybe every suit should have a few cards in it that ask you to sit in silence rather than roll dice. Maybe the possible additional dice oracle I am thinking of creating should have several points where the answer is not a result or a response but simply ‘maybe — you should think about it’. Maybe each explosively violent emotional Ignition should follow up with stark silence, an emotional drop like the abrupt and draining nightmare of Hotline Miami’s machine grinding to a sharp halt.

Sometimes, when you get inside something bad enough, you’d kill for a moment of quiet. Or, alternatively, the idea of things being quiet is so unbearable that you’d rather die than live in it.

Journaling games are uniquely positioned to bring that dynamic, a quiet that you’d kill for or a quiet that you’d kill to get out of, and make it an emotional centerpiece. Sure, you can worry about the starkness of it turning people off, but we’re in the business of making true things. When it comes to true raw things, you have to wait for them.
